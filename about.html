        </div>

      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <p>In the spring of 2012 the vision for a new congregation in Downtown Tampa was shared with the JCT Riverview Parish.
        After much prayer and many powerful moments of God’s favor toward this endeavor, Journey Church Tampa Downtown was planted in the spring of 2013 by a team of eleven people.</p>

        <p>Members of this plant team continued to meet in the evenings, faithfully serving the city blocks around them where there were little signs of life in the wake of the recession that had swept through Tampa.
        </p>

        <p>We as a church went through a transition in the early spring of 2015 bringing Pastor Corey Wolloff to the team as Parish Pastor and shifting our services to Sunday mornings.
          As the city has gained momentum and undergone incredible changes we have been right here in the middle of it all. We could not be happier with all that God is doing in Tampa.

        </p>
    <p>
          In the Winter of 2018 we underwent a full and complete renovation of our meeting space in downtown creating a beautiful building in which to meet together and serve the city well.
          Our Kids Church has expanded rapidly, God has been faithful to our church and we are absolutely convinced that the best is yet to come.
    </p>
      <p>
          The future is indeed bright. We welcome you to join in on the incredible story that God continues to write with our church in this city that we love.

      <h3>The Gospel</h3>
      <p>By believing the Gospel, you are brought into a new community (1 Corinthians 12:13). In the church, gospel-changed Christians now slowly become freed from the inner slavery and the social exclusion that marked their lives before. The church is where Christians with transformed identities begin to live out (partially, but significantly) the changed economic, social, racial, and family relationships that will mark the future kingdom of God, when Christ comes to completely heal all the alienation in the world and renew the whole earth. The church becomes the 'sign of the kingdom' for a broken world.

      <h3>The Apostles’ Creed</h3>
      <p>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord: Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.  The third day He arose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty, whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy (universal) church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.
      </p>

      <h3>The Nicene Creed</h3>
      <p>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made. Who, for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets. And I believe one holy (universal) and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>

        Every organization has a culture/ethos. It’s a way of doing things. At JCT, we want to make sure that the culture of our church is very clear. In order to keep our culture from becoming watered down, we have clear cultural distinctive that we want to keep at the center of everything we do. You will see these working no matter the parish you attend. Our heart is to live out (become practitioners of) each of these.
